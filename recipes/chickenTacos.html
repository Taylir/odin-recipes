    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      One of the easiest and create your own styles of dishes. Even with the
      recipe given you are able to mix and match with any vegtables, meats, or
      sauces and still have agood mix of flavor. Having the ability to grab
      almost whatever from the fridge and mix and mathc it with other foods
      helps clear out that slowly growing fridge of food as well!

    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ pounds (680 grams) chicken breasts skinless boneless</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>½ yellow onion minced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ cup (120 grams) salsa</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Poach chicken. Place chicken in a saucepan, and cover with water. Bring
        to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer for 10-12 minutes or until the
        internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F/74°C. I use the
        kitchen thermometer to check as overcooked chicken will be dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the chicken to a cutting board or bowl, and shred it with 2
        forks.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a skillet, heat oil and sauté the onion until it’s soft and
        translucent (3 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the garlic, and sauté for 30 seconds. Add cumin, oregano, chili
        powder, and salt. Cook for 1 more minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add salsa, and just mix it in (if necessary, you can add a splash of
        water) and let it warm up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken, and mix it in with the sauce. Simmer for 2-3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve in warmed up tortillas or taco shells with your favorite toppings
      </li>
    </ol>
