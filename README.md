**Why am I doing this.**
I am doing this for the fact I want to be a great developer, not just an ok one or one that gives up along the journey.
Even if this is currently past what I already know how to do or not at mentally challanging as writing JS Queries.
Redoing and making sure I pick up everything I can from other sources is my goal, I want to be able to do whatever I want in the world
of programming that I can. While I know there will still be times and new technologies that come out that I won't know.
With the strong base and foundation I plan on building, learning it and being able to expand on it is exactly what I want to do.

**Things that will be achieved with this task**
Looks like it will be some basic HTML stuff, so including links, imgs, and other basic HTML elements.
